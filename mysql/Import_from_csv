1. Import CSV file Process


For import the data:
1. First we create a dummy dataset for import in CSV

2. Query to Import
use testdb;
LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/lib/mysql/Records.csv' into table employee FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' IGNORE 1 ROWS;



3. some error occur during the import the following solution work for me:

adding secure-file-priv = "" | working this one
but you have to copy the file into mysql directory
in etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

//for local but not working | error is : OS errno - permission denied
to the last
[client]
local_infile=1
and set global local_infile = true;
for locally add data


FOR IMPORT THE DATA FROM TABLE TO CSV
SELECT * FROM employee INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql/r1.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ;
